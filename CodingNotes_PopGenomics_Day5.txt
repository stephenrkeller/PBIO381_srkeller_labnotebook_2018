Procedure for 3/19/18:

I. Finish running ADMIXTURE
	1. Convert vcf to geno format:
		A. Make sure you have a thinned and filtered vcf file in ~/myresults/out.recode.vcf
		B. Make sure the following files are in ~/myscripts (if you need them, get from /data/scripts/
			i. beetle.pop
				-contains ind IDs and pop designations; 2 col's; no header
			ii. beetle.spid
				-make sure filenames match "beetle" not "beetles"
				-make sure no paths; just filenames
			iii. vcf2geno.sh
				-open and check; make sure all paths and filenames are correct
		C. Make sure vcf2geno.sh is executable; chmod if needed
		D. Run vcf2geno.sh for file conversion
	2. Write bash script to run ADMIXTURE:
		A. Open previous script ADMIX.sh (mine is in ~myscripts/)
		B. Make it look exactly like this:
			#!/bin/bash
			for K in {1..10}
			do
			admixture -j4 --cv=10 ~/myresults/out.recode.vcf.geno $K | tee log${K}.out
			done
			grep "CV" log*out >chooseK.txt
		C. Check to make sure executable, then run ADMIX.sh
		D. cd to ~/myresults and cat chooseK.txt; infer evidence for optimal K value
		E. Download *.Q files (for K=2-5) to local drive and boot R to plot
		F. While we're at it, also download your vcf file to local drive for running PCA

II. Plot Q-values in R using Pophelper: (avail on tutorials under Day4)

install.packages(c("Cairo","ggplot2","gridExtra","gtable","tidyr","devtools"),dependencies=T)
devtools::install_github('royfrancis/pophelper')

library(pophelper)

setwd("/Users/srkeller/github/PBIO381_srkeller_labnotebook_2018/myresults/")

admixfiles=list.files(path=("ADMIXTURE/"),full.names=T)
admixlist=readQ(files=admixfiles,filetype="basic")

# metadata: sample id and pop from beetle.pop file
metadata=read.table("beetle.pop",header=F)

# format metadata to a data frame and ind variables as chars. for plotting
metadata2=data.frame(sampleid=metadata[,1], population=metadata[,2])

metadata2$sampleid=as.character(metadata2$sampleid)
metadata2$population=as.character(metadata2$population)

# add in the sample id to the different Q files for plotting
if(length(unique(sapply(admixlist,nrow)))==1)
  admixlist <- lapply(admixlist,"rownames<-",metadata2$sampleid)

head(admixlist[[3]])
